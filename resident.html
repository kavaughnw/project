        <p>
          In June 2017, Ethan Winters is drawn to a derelict plantation in
          Dulvey, Louisiana, by a message from his wife, Mia, who has been
          presumed dead since going missing in 2014. He finds Mia imprisoned in
          the basement of a seemingly abandoned house, but she becomes violent
          and attacks him, forcing him to kill her. After receiving a call from
          a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked by a revived
          Mia, who cuts his hand off. Jack, the patriarch of the Baker family,
          captures Ethan. After Zoe reattaches his hand, Ethan is held captive
          by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and an elderly
          catatonic woman in a wheelchair. Ethan escapes but is pursued around
          the house by Jack, who has powerful regenerative abilities. In the
          basement, Ethan discovers reanimated monsters known as Molded. Zoe
          reveals that she is Jack's daughter, and that the family and Mia are
          infected, but can be cured with a special serum. Ethan makes his way
          to an old house to retrieve the serum ingredients, kills Marguerite,
          and has visions of a young girl. Lucas captures Zoe and Mia and forces
          Ethan to navigate a booby-trapped barn to find them. Ethan chases away
          Lucas and frees Zoe and Mia. Zoe develops two serum doses, but they
          are attacked by Jack, now heavily mutated; Ethan kills him using one
          of the serums.[4] Ethan must choose to cure either Mia or Zoe.
          Choosing Zoe leaves Mia heartbroken, despite Ethan's promise to send
          help. As he and Zoe flee on a boat, Zoe reveals that the Bakers were
          infected after Mia arrived with a young girl named Eveline when the
          wreck of a tanker ship washed ashore. Eveline stops their escape by
          calcifying Zoe, killing her, and Ethan is knocked from the boat by a
          creature. If Ethan chooses Mia, Zoe gives a bitter farewell to him and
          Mia. As he and Mia flee on a boat, they come across the crashed
          tanker, where they are attacked by the creature and knocked from the
          boat. Mia awakens after she was knocked off the boat and searches the
          wrecked ship for Ethan while experiencing visions of Eveline, who
          refers to Mia as her mother. Eventually, Mia's memory is restored,
          revealing that she was a covert operative for a corporation that
          developed Eveline as a bioweapon, codenamed E-001. Mia and agent Alan
          Droney were to escort Eveline as she was transported aboard the
          tanker; Eveline escaped containment, killed Alan, and sank the ship.
          She infected Mia in an effort to force her to be her mother. Mia finds
          Ethan and gives him a vial of Eveline's genetic material.[4] If Ethan
          cured Mia, she resists Eveline's control long enough to seal Ethan out
          of the ship; if he cured Zoe, Mia succumbs to Eveline's control and
          attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. Ethan discovers a hidden
          laboratory inside an abandoned salt mine. He learns that Eveline is a
          bio-organic weapon capable of infecting people with a psychotropic
          mold that gives her control over her victims' minds, resulting in
          insanity, mutation, and superhuman regenerative abilities. Eveline
          grew up obsessed with having a family, driving her to infect Mia and
          the Bakers and lure Ethan. Lucas was immunized against Eveline's
          control by her creators, The Connections, in exchange for providing
          observations on her. Using the lab equipment and Eveline's genetic
          material, Ethan synthesizes a toxin to kill her, and proceeds through
          tunnels that lead back to the Baker house. He overcomes Eveline's
          hallucinations, and injects Eveline with the toxin. She reverts to her
          other form, the elderly woman in a wheelchair; Eveline has been
          rapidly aging since escaping. Eveline mutates into a large monster
          and, aided by the arrival of a military squad led by Chris Redfield,
          Ethan kills her with an anti-bioweapon pistol. Chris extracts Ethan
          (and Mia, if she survived) in a helicopter branded with the Umbrella
          Corporation logo.
